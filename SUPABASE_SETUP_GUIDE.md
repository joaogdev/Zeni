# 🎯 Supabase Integration Setup Guide

Your home gym fitness app has been successfully migrated from MongoDB to **Supabase (PostgreSQL)**! 

## ✅ What's Been Completed

✅ **Backend Migration**: FastAPI server now uses Supabase instead of MongoDB  
✅ **Environment Configuration**: Supabase credentials added to `.env` files  
✅ **Dependencies Installed**: Supabase Python and JavaScript clients installed  
✅ **API Testing**: Health check endpoint confirmed working  
✅ **Code Migration**: All database operations converted to Supabase API calls  

## 🚀 Next Steps - Database Setup

Your backend is ready, but you need to **create the database tables** in Supabase:

### 1. Access Your Supabase Dashboard
- Go to: [https://supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
- Navigate to your project: `wkmjaxehuxwukhhkjktl`

### 2. Create Database Tables
1. Click on **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar
2. Copy the entire content of `/app/supabase_schema.sql`
3. Paste it into the SQL Editor
4. Click **"Run"** to execute the script

### 3. Verify Tables Were Created
After running the SQL, you should see these tables in your database:
- `users` - User accounts and authentication
- `status_checks` - System status monitoring
- `password_reset_tokens` - Password recovery tokens
- `chat_messages` - AI chat conversations
- `workouts` - User workout plans

## 🔧 Configuration Details

### Backend Environment (already configured)
```
SUPABASE_URL="https://wkmjaxehuxwukhhkjktl.supabase.co"
SUPABASE_KEY="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs..." (your anon key)
```

### Frontend Environment (already configured)
```
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL="https://wkmjaxehuxwukhhkjktl.supabase.co"
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_KEY="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs..." (your anon key)
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

Once tables are created, test the integration:

```bash
cd /app
python test_supabase.py
```

This will test:
- ✅ Supabase connection
- ✅ Table creation
- ✅ Data insertion and retrieval

## 📋 App Features (All Migrated to Supabase)

Your app now uses Supabase for:
